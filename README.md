Questions & Solutions:-

1) What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.

Ans) So, i developed a web App with - Angular, In which i demonstrated how sorting algorithm works, how sorting is performing.
        & it was one of the proudest achievement for me because i have to visualize (render) the sorting algorithm is the UI, 
        so, i have to do some heavy research on it & i achieved it at last, cause i was failed for the first time. 
        after i named it -> visual Sorting 2.0

2) What's a personal project you're currently working on? This could be a coding side project, hobby, or otherwise real world project you're working on.

Ans) I was working on a self side project. I gathered all the requirements that i might need, 
        then, i created the system design for it. but eventually, i stop after designing it cause, the level of skill i might for the project i don't have now
        so, for this current year i am fully focused to improve & increase my skill set. so, that i can start working on my project without interruption.

3) Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why we should read it.

Ans) As, i am not book person but trying to develop this habit of book reading. so, i recently picked up 2-books for myself.
     Currently started the book :- 
            1) Cracking the coding Interview
            2) The Google Story
        so, These are the books i picked & read about 10-15 pages only. My idea here is to build a habit of reading first. to develop this i picked the
            books that are closest to my domain, 
        Therefore, 1st book -> is master all the domains of software engineering.
                   2nd book -> is to know the process how this tech giant build up from scratch.
    

4) Tell us about one of your favorite products (physical or software) and one specific aspect that makes it truly great.

Ans) Udemy.com, is my favorite place to visit. This ranks #1 in my bucket list of best software ever made. Cause with the help of this Udemy i learned many technical skills that i 
        have now. And this site really have Awesome peoples who great such great content to learn & grow.

5) In this repo is a data.json file. It contains an imaginary example set of data a customer might need to migrate from one system to another. It's a JSON encoded array of objects. The customer understands some of the data might be bad and wants to know which records are invalid so they can ensure the new system will only have valid data. Write a program that will read in the data and mark any records:

That are a duplicate of another record
name field is null, missing, or blank
address field is null, missing, or blank
zip is null, missing, or an invalid U.S. zipcode
Each record has an ID but that should only be used to identify a record, not for validity or duplication testing (eg, two records may be identical but have different IDs).

The output of the program should list the IDs of each invalid or duplicate record, one per line. In the case of duplicates, mark both.

Ans) Go To index.js file in this directory :- 
1) Developed this script in node js environment.
2) No depencency required, rather than Node Env.
3) CMD to Run the Script :- node index.js ( In the Same Directory ).
4) used stream to load the data.json file.
